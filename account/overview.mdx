## Overview

Aseed uses a token-based billing system. Tokens are consumed when you generate transcripts and reports. You can purchase tokens in packages, earn free tokens through referrals, and monitor your balance throughout your workflow.

## Token balance

Your token balance is displayed in the top navigation bar and shows how many tokens you have available. The balance updates automatically:

- **After purchases**: When you buy tokens, your balance refreshes immediately
- **After usage**: When you generate transcripts or reports, tokens are deducted from your balance
- **After referrals**: When someone signs up using your referral link, you receive 200 tokens

<Tip>
Your token balance is always visible in the navigation bar, so you can monitor your usage at any time.

## How tokens are used

Tokens are consumed when you perform certain actions in Aseed. The system calculates token costs based on several factors:

### Transcription tokens

Tokens are charged for generating transcripts from audio or video files. The cost depends on:

- **Interview length**: Longer interviews require more tokens
- **File type**: Audio and video files are processed differently
- **File size**: Larger files may require additional processing

<Tip>
Text transcripts uploaded directly don't require transcription tokens since they're already in text format.
</Tip>

### Report generation tokens

Tokens are charged for generating analysis reports. The cost depends on:

- **Report type**: Each report type (Q&A, General, Persona, JTBD, Custom) has a base cost
- **Number of reports**: The base cost is multiplied by the number of report types you select
- **Interview complexity**: More complex interviews may require additional processing

<Note>
You can see the estimated token cost before generating reports. The actual cost may vary slightly based on the complexity of your interview content.
</Note>

### Batch operations

When generating reports for multiple records in a project:

- **Transcripts**: Each record that needs transcription is charged separately
- **Reports**: Each report type for each record is charged separately
- **Total cost**: The system calculates the total tokens needed before you confirm the batch operation

<Tip>
Batch generation shows you the total token cost upfront, so you can ensure you have enough tokens before starting.
