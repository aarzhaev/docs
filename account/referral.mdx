## How referrals work

1. **You share your link**: Copy and share your unique referral link with friends, colleagues, or anyone interested in Aseed
2. **They sign up**: When someone clicks your link and creates an Aseed account, they're automatically associated with your referral
3. **You get tokens**: 200 tokens are automatically added to your balance
4. **No limits**: There's no limit to how many people you can refer or how many tokens you can earn

<Tip>
Referrals are a great way to earn free tokens while helping others discover Aseed. Share your link widely to maximize your token earnings.
