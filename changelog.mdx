## Navigation and Split View for Reports

**Navigation:** You can switch between projects and records from the navbar from almost anywhere in the app.

**Split view:** When viewing a project report, you can open a second panel and compare the main project report with single reports in the project side by side.

## Research Assistant and Ask Project

**Ask Project:** You can ask questions about project reports and get answers grounded in project documents with citations. You can also choose specific reports or records and ask questions only about that subset.

**Research Assistant:** The sidebar section formerly named "Research Context" is now "Research Assistant" and supports the full Ask Project workflow.

## More Reliable Under Load

**Backend architecture update:** We completed a major internal upgrade across the custdev backend, client, and LiveKit integration. You keep the same API and workflows.

**What you get:** Response times and stability under concurrent load are more predictable. Report generation, interview flows, and webhook processing are less likely to degrade during peak usage.

**No action required:** No changes to how you use Aseed; everything works as before, with better resilience.

## Transcription Quality Improvements

**Speaker labeling:** Transcripts now assign lines to the right speaker much more reliably across all languages.

**Speech to text:** Spoken words are now converted to text much more accurately, with the biggest gains for:
- Indonesian
- Kazakh
- Korean
- Russian
- Thai
- Ukrainian
- and other languages

**Mixed languages in Auto mode:** Multi-language mode now works in Auto mode, so one interview can include two or three languages.
