### Best practices

  <Accordion title="Fix speaker names first">
    Fix speaker names before generating reports. Incorrect speaker identification can significantly impact report accuracy.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Review transcripts promptly">
    Review transcripts soon after generation while the interview is fresh in your memory.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Focus on meaningful errors">
    Focus on fixing errors that affect meaning. Minor typos that don't change interpretation can be left as-is.
