    <Tip>
      When you save the guide to a project, it automatically populates the Interview Guide field in that project's Research Context section. If the project already has a guide, you'll be asked to confirm overwriting it.
    </Tip>

    <Note>
      Projects with existing guides show a **"Has guide"** badge. Projects without guides show **"No guide"** badge. This helps you see which projects already have interview guides.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How it works
The AI agent uses natural language processing to:
- Ask contextual questions in your language
- Adapt the conversation based on your answers
- Determine when enough information has been collected
- Generate a structured guide with numbered questions

## Token usage and cost

The AI Agent uses tokens for each assistant message. You can choose between two reasoning modes:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Fast mode" icon="zap">
    **Cost:** 2 tokens per assistant message
    
    Use Fast mode for quick responses and standard guide generation. This mode provides fast, efficient answers suitable for most use cases.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Thinking mode" icon="brain">
    **Cost:** 5 tokens per assistant message
    
    Use Thinking mode for more complex research scenarios that require deeper analysis and reasoning. This mode provides more thorough responses and better handles nuanced requirements.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
You can switch between Fast and Thinking modes at any time during the conversation using the mode selector in the input area. Choose Fast mode for speed and efficiency, or Thinking mode when you need more comprehensive analysis. Tokens are only charged for assistant messages, not for your questions or input.
</Tip>

<Note>
**Example:** If the AI asks 10 questions and you answer each one, that's 10 assistant responses. In Fast mode, this costs 20 tokens (10 × 2). In Thinking mode, this costs 50 tokens (10 × 5). Your questions don't cost tokens.
</Note>

<Note>
For more details about token usage and costs, see [Token usage](/account/usage).
</Note>

<Tip>
You can ask the AI to modify the guide after it's generated. For example, request a shorter version, add specific topics, or change the style.
</Tip>

## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be specific about research goals">
    Be specific about your research goals. The more context you provide, the better the guide will be tailored to your needs.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Skip questions if needed">
    If you don't know the answer to a question, click the **Skip** button on the question card. The AI will ask alternative questions to gather the information it needs. Skipping is useful when:
    - You haven't decided on a particular aspect yet
    - The question doesn't apply to your research
    - You want to provide that information later
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Choose the right reasoning mode">
    Select **Fast** mode (2 tokens) for quick responses and standard guide generation. Use **Thinking** mode (5 tokens) when you need deeper analysis for complex research scenarios. You can switch modes at any time during the conversation using the mode selector in the input area.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Provide materials instead of Q&A">
    If you have existing research materials, documentation, or notes, you can provide them in your first message. The AI will analyze the materials and extract information, asking only follow-up questions about missing or unclear details. This can save time compared to answering questions one by one.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Save guide directly to project">
    After generating a guide, use the **Save** button in the guide panel to save it directly to a project. This automatically populates the Interview Guide field in that project's Research Context section, eliminating the need to copy and paste manually.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Modify generated guides">
    You can ask the AI to modify the guide after it's generated. For example:
    - "Make the guide shorter"
    - "Add questions about pricing"
    - "Focus more on user pain points"
    - "Change the style to be more conversational"
    
    The AI will update the guide based on your requirements.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Understanding the guide structure">
    Generated guides follow a structured format:
    - **Introduction Section**: Research overview and objectives
    - **Question Blocks**: Organized into logical subsections (e.g., Opening, Main Questions, Follow-up, Closing)
    - **Researcher Recommendations**: Tips and things to watch for
    - **Preparation Checklist**: What to prepare before interviews
    
    Questions are numbered and include optional follow-up questions for deeper exploration.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Ask questions about Aseed

The AI Agent can answer questions about Aseed features, workflows, and best practices. Click **"Ask About Service"** in the empty state or ask questions like:
- "How do I create a project?"
- "What report types does Aseed support?"
- "How does batch generation work?"
- "What is the difference between Q&A and General reports?"

Messages with documentation answers are marked with a **"Documentation"** tag to indicate they're based on Aseed documentation.
