## Overview
The Interview Guide Builder uses AI to help you create comprehensive interview guides. The AI agent asks questions about your research goals, target audience, and context, then generates a structured guide with numbered questions organized into logical sections.

## How to create an interview guide
<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Interview Guide Builder">
    Navigate to **Interview Guide** in the sidebar (available to admins) or go to `/space/agent`.

    - Research overview and objectives
    - Numbered questions organized into logical sections
    - Follow-up questions for deeper exploration
    - Researcher recommendations
    - Preparation checklist

## How it works
The AI agent uses natural language processing to:
- Ask contextual questions in your language
- Adapt the conversation based on your answers
- Determine when enough information has been collected
- Generate a structured guide with numbered questions

<Tip>
You can ask the AI to modify the guide after it's generated. For example, request a shorter version, add specific topics, or change the style.
</Tip>

## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be specific about research goals">
    Be specific about your research goals. The more context you provide, the better the guide will be tailored to your needs.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Skip questions if needed">
    You can skip questions if you don't have the answer. The AI will ask alternative questions to gather the information it needs.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use guide in project context">
    After generating a guide, you can copy it and paste it into your project's Research Context section for use during interviews.
