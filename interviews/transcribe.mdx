## Overview

Transcripts are the foundation for all reports. Configure transcription settings before generating transcripts to ensure accuracy and proper speaker identification.

## Transcription settings

Before starting transcription, configure these settings in the **Setup** tab of your record:

### Transcript language

Select the language of your interview to improve transcription accuracy. The system supports:

- **Auto detection** - Automatically detects the language
- **Main languages**: English, Russian, Kazakh, Uzbek, Turkmen, Ukrainian, German, French, Spanish, Indonesian
- **Other languages**: 50+ additional languages including Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, and more

<Tip>
Selecting the correct language significantly improves transcription accuracy, especially for non-English languages.
</Tip>

<Note>
In **Auto detection**, multi-language mode is enabled by default. One interview can include two or more languages, and transcription will continue without manual switching.
</Note>

### Number of participants

Specify the number of participants in your interview:

- **Automatic detection** - Let the system detect participants automatically
- **Manual selection** - Choose from 1 to 12 participants

### Participant names

Add known participant names to help the system identify speakers:

1. Enter participant names in the **Participant Name** fields
2. Add multiple participants using the **Add Participant** button
3. Remove participants by clicking the X button next to their name

<Tip>
Providing participant names helps the system correctly identify speakers throughout the transcript, making reports more accurate.
</Tip>
