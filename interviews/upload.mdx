## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use clear file names">
    Use clear file names that help you identify respondents later, for example: "Interview_John_Doe_2024-01-15.mp4"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Upload multiple files at once">
    You can upload multiple files at once. The system will process them sequentially.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Format text files correctly">
    For text files, ensure they're properly formatted transcripts or notes that Aseed can process. See [Upload text transcripts](/interviews/text-transcripts) for detailed information about text file formats and parsers.
