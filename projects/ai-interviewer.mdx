## Overview

AI Interviewer runs live voice interviews through unique links. You create links in a project, share them with respondents, and each completed session is saved as a project record.

## Before you start

<Note>
To create and use interview links, fill both **Research Goals** and **Interview Guide** in the project context first.
</Note>

You should also have enough tokens available for the links you create. Link creation reserves tokens based on link count and duration.

## Create interview links

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open your project">
    Go to a project, then scroll to the **AI Interviewer** section.

</Steps>

## Manage interview links

After creation, links appear in three tabs:
- **Active**: pending and in-progress links
- **Completed**: finished interviews
- **Archived**: cancelled or expired links

### Link statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `pending` | Link is created but interview has not started. |
| `active` | Respondent is currently in session. |
| `completed` | Interview is finished and saved. |
| `expired` | Link validity period ended. |
| `cancelled` | Link was cancelled manually. |

### Row actions

Depending on status, you can:
- **Copy link**
- **Open link**
- **Rename** (pending links)
- **Edit Context** (pending links)
- **Cancel** (pending links)

## What respondents see

Respondents open `/interview/[token]` without login, enter email, and join the voice interview. The page includes onboarding cards, microphone permission flow, call controls, and a countdown timer.

Key behavior:
- Rejoin is supported for the same email while the interview is still active.
- If the call ends from timer or explicit leave, the session is marked complete.
- The transcript panel is available during and after the call.

## After interview completion

When a session completes, Aseed stores it in the project as a record. You can then:
- Open transcript and review interview content
- Generate single reports for this record
- Include the record in project reports

<Tip>
AI Interviewer works best with specific Research Goals and Interview Guide content. Strong context improves both interview quality and report relevance.
</Tip>

## Token behavior

- Tokens are reserved when you create links.
- Reservation size depends on link count and duration.
- Final charging happens when interviews move to **completed**.
- Cancelled or expired links do not consume completed-session charges.
