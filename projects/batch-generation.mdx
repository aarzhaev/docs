## Overview
Batch generation lets you create reports for multiple records simultaneously. You can generate transcripts and various report types (Q&A, General, JTBD, Persona, Custom) for all selected records in one operation, saving significant time compared to generating reports individually.

## How to generate reports in batch
<Steps>
  <Step title="Open your project">
    Navigate to the project containing the records you want to process.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start batch generation">
    Scroll to the bottom of the Project Records section. Click the **Generate Reports** button (or the progress indicator if generation is already in progress).

  <Step title="Choose regeneration option">
    Toggle **Regenerate existing reports** if you want to overwrite reports that already exist for these records.

## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with Transcript and Q&A">
    Start with Transcript and Q&A reports for most records, then add other types as needed. This balances cost with value.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use batch generation for efficiency">
    Use batch generation when you have multiple records ready to process. It's more efficient than generating reports one by one.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Review research context first">
    Review your project's Research Goals and Interview Guide before batch generation—they're automatically included in the context for better results.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Monitor token balance">
    Monitor token balance before large batch operations. Consider processing in smaller batches if token costs are high.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use regenerate carefully">
    Use "Regenerate existing reports" carefully—it will overwrite existing reports and consume tokens again.
  </Accordion>
