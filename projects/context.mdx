## Overview

The **Research Assistant** is the AI-powered section in the sidebar (link **Research Assistant** or path `/space/agent`). It helps you prepare and use research context, interview guides, and project documents in one place.

**What you can do:**

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Research context brief" icon="file-text">
    Generate a structured Research Context Brief through an interactive Q&A. The brief defines goals, hypotheses, and method. Save it to a project's Research Goals.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Interview guide" icon="map">
    Create or refine interview guides with the AI. Save guides directly to a project or use them in the Interview Guide Builder.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Ask Project" icon="search">
    Ask questions about your project reports. Get answers grounded in project documents with citations. Optionally scope to the whole project or to specific reports and records.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Documentation" icon="book">
    Ask questions about Aseed features, workflows, and best practices. Answers are based on up-to-date documentation.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Research context (goals and interview guide) tells Aseed what you want to learn and how interviews should run. You can add it in two ways:

- **AI Generation**: Use the Research Assistant to generate a Research Context Brief through an interactive Q&A session
- **Manual Entry**: Write or paste research goals and interview guide in the project (Research Goals and Interview Guide cards)

## Ask Project

Ask Project lets you ask questions about your project's reports and get answers that cite the actual project documents.

**How it works:**

1. **Turn on Ask Project** — Click the **Ask Project** suggestion in the empty state or use the **`+`** button and choose **Ask Project**. Select one or more projects. The first time you use a project, Aseed indexes its documents (project report, single reports, transcripts); indexing may take a short time.
2. **Ask a question** — Type your question in the chat. The assistant searches the selected project's documents and returns an answer with **citations** to the source report or record.
3. **Scope to specific documents (optional)** — By default, answers use all indexed documents in the selected project(s). You can narrow the scope: open the project selector and choose specific **reports** or **records**. Questions then use only those documents, so you can "talk" to a subset (e.g. one report or a few records) instead of the whole project.

**When to use Ask Project:**

- Summarize or compare findings across several reports
- Find where a theme or quote appears in the project
- Ask follow-up questions about a single report or a few records
- Check claims against the actual project content

Answers are grounded in your project data; citations link back to the source so you can verify and reuse the information.

## Generate research context with AI

The Research Assistant can build a Research Context Brief by asking focused questions about your project.

The brief includes 11 sections: metadata, decision framing, product context, goals, questions, hypotheses, participants, method, analysis, outputs, glossary, and limitations.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Research Assistant">
    Navigate to the Research Assistant (sidebar link or `/space/agent`). You'll see an empty state with suggestion buttons.

      Dark variant: images/projects-context-agent-empty-state-dark.png
    */}
  </Step>
  <Step title="Request a research context brief">
    You can start in two ways:
    - **Click the suggestion button**: Click **"Create Research Context"** in the empty state
    - **Type a message**: Ask the assistant to create a research context brief. For example:
      - "Create a research context brief for my project"
      - "Help me define research goals and hypotheses"
      - "I need to prepare a research context"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Answer questions or provide materials">
    You have two options:
    
    **Option 1: Answer questions interactively**
    The AI will ask you questions about:
    - Research type and stage
    - Decision framing (what decisions will be made)
    - Product or service context
    - Research goals and questions
    - Target participants and segments
    - Research method and protocol
    - Hypotheses to test
    - Analysis approach
    - Expected outputs
    
    Answer each question so the AI can build a complete brief.
    
    **Option 2: Provide materials**
    If you already have notes or materials, share them in your first message (or later when asked). The AI will extract what it can and ask follow-up questions only for missing details.

    <Tip>
      **Tips for answering questions:**
      - **Choose your reasoning mode**: Switch between **Fast** (2 tokens) and **Thinking** (5 tokens). Use Fast for most tasks and Thinking for complex cases.
      - **Skip questions if needed**: If you don't know the answer, click the **Skip** button. The AI will ask alternative questions.
      - **Long messages are automatically collapsed**: If your message is longer than 500 characters, it will be collapsed with a "Show more" button. Click to expand and see the full message.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review and generate">
    After gathering enough information, the assistant will show a summary. Review it and confirm to generate the research context brief.
  </Step>
  <Step title="View and save the brief">
    Once generated, you'll see:
    1. **Preview card in chat** — A card showing the first few lines of the brief with a **View** button
    2. **Full brief panel** — Click **View** to open the complete brief in a panel on the right side

    Use the **Save** button in the brief panel to:
    - **Download as Markdown** — Save the brief as a `.md` file
    - **Copy to clipboard** — Copy the brief text for pasting elsewhere
    - **Save directly to a project** — Select a project from the dropdown to attach the brief to that project's Research Goals field

      Context: Step 5 showing the save options available for the generated Research Context Brief.
      Dark variant: images/projects-context-save-menu-dark.png
    */}

    <Tip>
      When you save the brief to a project, it populates the Research Goals field in that project. If the project already has research goals, you'll be asked to confirm overwriting them.
    </Tip>

    <Note>
      Projects with research context show a **"Has context"** badge. Projects without it show **"No context"**.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Token usage and cost

The Research Assistant uses tokens for each assistant message when generating a research context brief. You can choose between two reasoning modes:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Fast mode" icon="zap">
    **Cost:** 2 tokens per assistant message
    
    Use Fast mode for quick responses and standard brief generation. This mode provides fast, efficient answers suitable for most use cases.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Thinking mode" icon="brain">
    **Cost:** 5 tokens per assistant message
    
    Use Thinking mode for more complex research scenarios that require deeper analysis and reasoning. This mode provides more thorough responses and better handles nuanced requirements.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
You can switch between Fast and Thinking at any time with the mode selector. Use Fast for speed and Thinking for deeper analysis. Tokens are charged only for assistant messages.
</Tip>

<Note>
**Example:** If the AI asks 10 questions and you answer each one, that's 10 assistant responses. In Fast mode, this costs 20 tokens (10 × 2). In Thinking mode, this costs 50 tokens (10 × 5). Your questions don't cost tokens.
</Note>

<Note>
For more details about token usage and costs, see [Token usage](/account/usage).

  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use the Research Assistant to generate a brief">
    For new projects, use the Research Assistant to generate a research context brief. The assistant guides you through required sections and creates a document you can save directly to the project.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Choose the right reasoning mode">
    Select **Fast** mode (2 tokens) for quick responses and standard brief generation. Use **Thinking** mode (5 tokens) when you need deeper analysis for complex research scenarios. You can switch modes at any time during the conversation using the mode selector in the input area.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Provide materials instead of Q&A">
    If you have existing research materials, documentation, or notes, you can provide them in your first message. The AI will analyze the materials and extract information, asking only follow-up questions about missing or unclear details. This can save time compared to answering questions one by one.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Skip questions if needed">
    If you don't know the answer to a question, click the **Skip** button on the question card. The AI will ask alternative questions to gather the information it needs. Skipping is useful when you haven't decided on a particular aspect yet or the question doesn't apply to your research.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Modify existing briefs">
    You can ask the assistant to modify an existing research context brief. For example:
    - "Add more details about hypotheses"
    - "Update the participant segments"
    - "Change the analysis approach to focus on JTBD"
    - "Make the brief shorter"
    
    The AI will regenerate the brief based on your modifications.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Understanding validation and follow-up questions">
    The assistant uses validation to ensure your research context brief is complete. If important information is missing, the AI will ask follow-up questions with different priorities:
    - **Must** questions: Critical information needed before generation
    - **Should** questions: Helpful but not required
    
    The AI prioritizes "must" questions and won't ask for confirmation to generate until all critical information is collected.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Fallback generation">
    If there's an error during generation (e.g., LLM service unavailable), the system uses a fallback template to create the brief from collected data. Fallback documents are marked with "(fallback)" in the title and include a warning message. While functional, fallback documents may lack some contextual refinement. You can regenerate the brief when the service is available.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Force specific tool calls

You can force the Research Assistant to use a specific tool for your request. This ensures your message is processed with the right context and capabilities.

    **Option 1: Use the action button**
    - Click the **`+`** button in the input toolbar
    - Select an action from the dropdown menu:
      - **Research Assistant**: Force the assistant to create research context briefs
      - **Interview Guide**: Force the assistant to generate interview guides
      - **Ask Project**: Force the assistant to answer using project documents (with citations)
      - **Documentation**: Force the assistant to answer questions about Aseed
    
    **Option 2: Use slash commands**
    - Type **`/`** in the message input
    - A menu appears with the same action options
    - Select an action to apply it to your message
    
    The selected action appears as a badge next to the input. You can remove it by clicking the badge.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send your message">
    Type your message and send it. The AI will process your request using the selected tool, ensuring the response is tailored to that specific function.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Forcing a tool is especially useful when you want to:
  - Ensure your research context request uses the Research Assistant tool
  - Make sure your guide request uses the Interview Guide tool
  - Get answers grounded in project documents using Ask Project
  - Get documentation-specific answers using the Documentation tool
</Tip>

<Note>
  When an action is selected, messages are marked with a badge indicating which tool is being used (e.g., "Context Builder", "Guide Builder", "Ask Project", "Documentation").
</Note>

## Ask questions about Aseed

The Research Assistant can answer questions about Aseed features, workflows, and best practices. Click **"Ask About Service"** in the empty state or ask questions like:
- "How do I create a project?"
- "What report types does Aseed support?"
- "How does batch generation work?"
- "How do I export reports?"

You can also force documentation mode by selecting the **Documentation** action before asking your question. This ensures the AI uses the documentation tool to provide accurate, up-to-date answers.

Messages with documentation answers are marked with a **"Documentation"** tag to indicate they're based on Aseed documentation.
