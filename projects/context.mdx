title: "Add research context"
description: "Provide research goals and interview guide to help Aseed analyze interviews accurately."
---

## Overview
Research context helps Aseed understand your research objectives and interview structure. This information is automatically included when generating reports, making the analysis more accurate and aligned with your goals.

You can add research context in two ways:
- **AI Generation**: Use the AI Agent to generate a Research Context Brief through an interactive Q&A session
- **Manual Entry**: Write or paste your research goals and interview guide directly

## Generate research context with AI

The AI Agent can help you create a comprehensive Research Context Brief by asking questions about your research project. This is especially useful if you're starting a new project or want to structure your research systematically.

The Research Context Brief includes 11 sections covering all aspects of your research: metadata, decision framing, product context, goals, questions, hypotheses, participants, method, analysis, outputs, glossary, and limitations.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open AI Agent">
    Navigate to the AI Agent interface (available in the sidebar or at `/space/agent`). You'll see an empty state with suggestion buttons.

    */}
  </Step>
  <Step title="Request Research Context">
    You can start in two ways:
    - **Click the suggestion button**: Click **"Create Research Context"** button in the empty state
    - **Type a message**: Ask the AI to create a research context brief. For example:
      - "Create a research context brief for my project"
      - "Help me define research goals and hypotheses"
      - "I need to prepare a research context"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Answer questions or provide materials">
    You have two options:
    
    **Option 1: Answer questions interactively**
    The AI will ask you questions about:
    - Research type and stage
    - Decision framing (what decisions will be made)
    - Product or service context
    - Research goals and questions
    - Target participants and segments
    - Research method and protocol
    - Hypotheses to test
    - Analysis approach
    - Expected outputs
    
    Answer each question to help the AI build a comprehensive brief.
    
    **Option 2: Provide materials**
    If you have existing research materials, documentation, or notes, you can provide them in your first message or when the AI asks. The AI will analyze the materials and extract information, asking only follow-up questions about missing or unclear details.

    <Tip>
      **Choose your reasoning mode**: Use the mode selector in the input area to switch between **Fast** (2 tokens) and **Thinking** (5 tokens) modes. Fast mode is suitable for most cases, while Thinking mode provides deeper analysis for complex scenarios.
    </Tip>

    <Tip>
      **Skip questions if needed**: If you don't know the answer, click the **Skip** button. The AI will ask alternative questions.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review and generate">
    After gathering enough information, the AI will show a summary. Review it and confirm to generate the Research Context Brief.
  </Step>
  <Step title="View and save the brief">
    Once generated, you'll see:
    1. **Preview card in chat** - A card showing the first few lines of the brief with a **View** button
    2. **Full brief panel** - Click **View** to open the complete brief in a panel on the right side
    
    Use the **Save** button in the brief panel to:
    - **Download as Markdown** - Save the brief as a `.md` file with automatic filename formatting
    - **Copy to clipboard** - Copy the brief text for pasting elsewhere
    - **Save directly to a project** - Select a project from the dropdown to attach the brief to that project's Research Goals field

      Context: Step 5 showing the save options available for the generated Research Context Brief.
      Dark variant: images/projects-context-save-menu-dark.png
    */}

    <Tip>
      When you save the Research Context Brief to a project, it automatically populates the Research Goals field in that project's Research Context section. If the project already has research goals, you'll be asked to confirm overwriting them.
    </Tip>

    <Note>
      Projects with existing research context show a **"Has context"** badge. Projects without context show **"No context"** badge. This helps you see which projects already have research goals defined.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Token usage and cost

The AI Agent uses tokens for each assistant message when generating Research Context Brief. You can choose between two reasoning modes:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Fast mode" icon="zap">
    **Cost:** 2 tokens per assistant message
    
    Use Fast mode for quick responses and standard brief generation. This mode provides fast, efficient answers suitable for most use cases.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Thinking mode" icon="brain">
    **Cost:** 5 tokens per assistant message
    
    Use Thinking mode for more complex research scenarios that require deeper analysis and reasoning. This mode provides more thorough responses and better handles nuanced requirements.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
You can switch between Fast and Thinking modes at any time during the conversation using the mode selector in the input area. Choose Fast mode for speed and efficiency, or Thinking mode when you need more comprehensive analysis. Tokens are only charged for assistant messages, not for your questions or input.
</Tip>

<Note>
**Example:** If the AI asks 10 questions and you answer each one, that's 10 assistant responses. In Fast mode, this costs 20 tokens (10 × 2). In Thinking mode, this costs 50 tokens (10 × 5). Your questions don't cost tokens.
</Note>

<Note>
For more details about token usage and costs, see [Token usage](/account/usage).
