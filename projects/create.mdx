## Overview
A project is the container for your research. It groups interviews, context, and reports so you can synthesize results in one place. You can create a project with or without files—files can be uploaded during creation or added later.

## How to create a project
<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Create Project">
    In your workspace, click **Create Project** button in the Projects page or use the button in the sidebar.

  </Card>
  <Card title="Files uploading" icon="cloud-upload">
    If you added files, they upload asynchronously in the background.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Monitor progress" icon="eye">
    You can see upload progress on the project page.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Auto-linked" icon="link">
    Files are automatically linked to the project.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use consistent naming patterns">
    Use a naming pattern like "Product - Study - Month" so projects are easy to scan in the list.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Create project structure first">
    You can create a project without files and add them later. This is useful when you want to set up the project structure first.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Retry failed uploads">
    If file upload fails, you'll see a notification. You can upload the files again from the project page.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
