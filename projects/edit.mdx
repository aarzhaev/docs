## Project statuses

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="New" icon="circle">
    Recently created projects that haven't been started yet.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Opened" icon="play">
    Active projects where you're currently conducting research or generating reports.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Closed" icon="check-circle">
    Completed projects or projects you're no longer actively working on.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
Status helps you filter projects in the Projects list. Use it to quickly find active work versus completed research.

  <Accordion title="Keep names concise and descriptive">
    Keep project names concise but descriptive. Update them if the research focus changes significantly.

    Use descriptions to add context that isn't obvious from the name, such as research timeline or key stakeholders.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Update status regularly">
    Update status as you progress through your research workflow to keep your project list organized.
  </Accordion>
