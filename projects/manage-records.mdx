    Rename records immediately after upload with descriptive names that include respondent information or interview date.

    Archive records you've completed analyzing but want to keep for reference. This keeps your active list focused on current work.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Remove from wrong project">
    Use "Remove from Project" if you accidentally added a record to the wrong project. The record stays available for other projects.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Archive instead of delete">
    Only delete records when you're certain you don't need them. Consider archiving instead if you might need them later.
