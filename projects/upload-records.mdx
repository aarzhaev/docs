## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use clear file names">
    Use clear file names that help you identify respondents later, for example: "Interview_John_Doe_2024-01-15.mp4"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Upload in batches">
    Upload files in batches rather than one at a time for better efficiency.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Format text files correctly">
    For text files, ensure they're properly formatted transcripts or notes that Aseed can process.
