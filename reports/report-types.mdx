Aseed generates different types of reports, each designed for specific analysis needs. Each report type uses a different methodology and structure to extract insights from interview transcripts. Understanding what each report contains helps you choose the right type for your research goals.

## Report types

- **[Transcript](/reports/report-types/transcript)** - Raw text conversion from audio/video files.

- **[Q&amp;A](/reports/report-types/qa)** - Structured question-answer pairs with citations.

- **[General](/reports/report-types/general)** - Comprehensive profile, insights, and recommendations.

- **[JTBD](/reports/report-types/jtbd)** - Jobs-to-be-Done framework analysis.

- **[Persona](/reports/report-types/persona)** - Deep persona profile with motivations and pain points.

- **[Custom](/reports/report-types/custom)** - Tailored analysis based on your specific prompt.

All reports (except Transcript) follow a two-stage process:

1. **Draft generation**: Creates initial report from transcript
2. **Refinement**: Validates against transcript, corrects errors, enhances insights

This ensures accuracy and quality in the final output.
