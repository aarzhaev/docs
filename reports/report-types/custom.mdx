## What it is
A **Custom Report** is a flexible, tailored analysis that adapts its structure and content based on your specific prompt. Unlike fixed-format reports, it designs the optimal report structure to answer your unique research questions.

## Methodology
- **Dynamic structure**: Builds report sections based on your custom prompt
- **Intelligence analysis**: Deconstructs your prompt to understand core questions and audience
- **Section selection**: Chooses relevant sections from a palette of analysis frameworks
- **Deep synthesis**: Goes beyond summarization to find why and connect patterns
- **Business value translation**: Converts insights into business impact

|---------|-------------|
| **Summary / TL;DR** | Executive summary of findings |
