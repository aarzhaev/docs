## What it is
A **General Report** provides a comprehensive analysis of the interview, structured into three main sections: Profile, Insights, and Recommendations. It's designed for product managers and researchers who need a complete understanding of the respondent.

## Methodology
- **Profile analysis**: Extracts respondent demographics, goals, motivations, pain points, emotions, and tools
- **Insight synthesis**: Identifies key findings, barriers, engagement levels, and expectations
- **Actionable recommendations**: Provides specific steps for product and service improvements
- **Evidence-based**: Every insight supported by quotes from the transcript with utterance citations

## Structure

The General report includes three main sections:

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Profile Section** | General Info, Goals, Motivations, Pain Points, Emotions, and Tools |
| **Insights Section** | Key Insights, Barriers, Engagement, and Expectations |
| **Recommendations Section** | Actionable Steps, Product Improvements, and Service Enhancements |
