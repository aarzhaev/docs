## What it is
A **JTBD (Jobs-to-be-Done) Report** analyzes the interview through the Jobs-to-be-Done framework. It identifies the fundamental jobs users are trying to accomplish and provides a structured analysis of their journey, desired outcomes, and opportunities for innovation.

## Methodology
- **Jobs-to-be-Done framework**: Identifies core jobs and sub-jobs users want to accomplish
- **Job Stories**: Structured format: When context, I want to action, So that outcome
- **Outcome-Driven Innovation (ODI)**: Calculates opportunity scores for desired outcomes
- **Job Map**: Visualizes the user's journey through job steps
- **Forces of Progress**: Analyzes what drives users to switch solutions

## Structure

The JTBD report includes:

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Executive Summary** | Main insights, key quotes, and action steps |
| **Job Stories** | Hierarchical list of Jobs and SubJobs |
| **Job Map** | Step-by-step journey visualization |
| **Forces of Progress** | Analyzing switching triggers |
| **Current Alternatives and Context** | Alternatives and context |
| **Desired Outcomes (ODI)** | Opportunity scores for innovation priorities |
| **Barriers, Frictions and Risks** | Obstacles and risks |
| **Evidence-based Insights** | Insights supported by quotes |
| **Recommendations and Hypotheses** | Hypotheses with prioritization |
| **Appendices** | Limitations and glossary |
