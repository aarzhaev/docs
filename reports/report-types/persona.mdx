## What it is
A **Persona Report** creates a deep, actionable persona profile based on the interview. It synthesizes the respondent's characteristics, motivations, pain points, and behaviors into a strategic persona that guides product development and marketing decisions.

## Methodology
- **Persona synthesis**: Combines demographics, context, and behavioral patterns
- **Jobs-to-be-Done integration**: Identifies core jobs within the persona context
- **Motivation analysis**: Deep dive into what drives user behavior
- **Pain point mapping**: Identifies frustrations and their impact
- **Behavioral patterns**: Documents workarounds and actual usage behaviors
- **Ideal solution vision**: Describes the perfect solution from the user's perspective

## Structure

The Persona report includes:

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Persona summary** | Memorable name and overview |
| **Demographics and Background** | Background and context |
| **Core Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD)** | Jobs-to-be-Done with job stories |
| **Key Motivations and Drivers** | Primary drivers of behavior with quotes |
| **Major Pain Points and Frustrations** | Major frustrations and obstacles with quotes |
| **Behaviors and Workarounds** | Actual behaviors and workarounds |
| **The Ideal Solution** | Vision of the perfect product/service |
| **Summary** | Key questions answered |
