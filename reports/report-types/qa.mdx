## What it is
A **Q&A Report** extracts and organizes all questions and answers from the interview into a structured format. It preserves the conversational flow while making it easy to find specific information.

## Methodology
- **Extraction-based**: Pulls questions and answers directly from the transcript
- **Topic grouping**: Organizes Q&A pairs into logical topics or sections
- **Citation tracking**: Every question and answer includes utterance numbers for verification
- **Light editing**: Removes fillers and transcription errors while preserving meaning

## Structure

The Q&A report follows this structure:

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Main summary** | Key insights at the report level |
| **Topic sections** | Organized by topic with subsection summaries |
| **Question and answer pairs** | Question and answer pairs with utterance citations |
| **First-person answers** | Respondent's answers preserved in their voice |
