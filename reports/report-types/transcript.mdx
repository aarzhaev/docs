## What it is
A **Transcript** is the raw text output from converting audio or video files to text. It's the foundation for all other reports - every analysis report requires a transcript first.

## Structure

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Plain text format** | Raw conversation text with speaker identification |
| **Utterance numbers** | Each line or segment is numbered for reference |
| **Speaker labels** | Identifies interviewer and respondent |
| **Timestamps** | Optional timing information for each segment |

## How it's generated
Transcripts are created using automated speech-to-text technology (AssemblyAI). The system:
- Processes audio/video files
- Identifies speakers
- Converts speech to text
- Numbers each utterance for citation in other reports

<Tip>
Always review and edit your transcript before generating analysis reports. Accurate transcripts lead to better insights.
