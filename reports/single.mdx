## Overview

Single reports analyze one interview record in isolation. Each report focuses on a single transcript and extracts insights specific to that interview. These reports are the building blocks for project-level synthesis—use them to understand individual interviews before creating aggregated project reports.

## How to generate single reports

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open your project">
    Navigate to the project containing the records you want to analyze.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open Generate Reports">
    In the **Project Records** section, scroll to the bottom and click **Generate Reports** button.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Select records">
    In the generation modal, select which records you want to generate reports for. You can select one or multiple records.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose report types">
    Select the report types you need for each interview. You can select multiple types:
    - **Transcript** (always required for other reports)

    - **General** - Comprehensive insights
    - **JTBD** - Jobs-to-be-Done analysis
    - **Persona** - Persona development
    - **Custom** - Custom analysis with your prompt

    <Tip>
      Start with Transcript and Q&A for most interviews. These provide a solid foundation and are cost-effective.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure options">
    Set language options and any custom prompts if you selected Custom reports. Review the token estimate before generating.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start generation">
    Click **Generate** to start report generation. The modal closes, and you'll see progress indicators on each record.

    Research Goals and Interview Guide from your project are automatically included in report context.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Token consumption" icon="coins">
    Tokens are consumed when generation starts. Check the estimate before generating.

## When to use single reports

- **Analyze individual interviews in detail** - Get deep insights from each respondent
- **Extract specific insights** - Focus on one interview's unique findings
- **Review interview quality** - Assess content and accuracy before aggregation
- **Generate reports for standalone interviews** - Create reports for interviews that don't need synthesis
- **Build foundation for project reports** - Create single reports first, then synthesize into project reports

## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with Transcript and Q&A">
    Start with Transcript and Q&A reports for most interviews. These provide a solid foundation and are cost-effective. You can always add other report types later if needed.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Review transcripts before generating">
    Review and edit transcripts before generating reports. Accurate transcripts lead to better insights. Fix speaker names and correct any transcription errors to improve report quality.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use General reports for comprehensive analysis">
    Use General reports when you need comprehensive analysis of a single interview with insights and recommendations. This report type provides a complete respondent profile.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Generate JTBD or Persona for specific frameworks">
    Generate JTBD or Persona reports when you have clear research goals aligned with those frameworks. These specialized reports provide deep insights using established methodologies.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use Custom reports for targeted questions">
    Use Custom reports to answer specific research questions or apply frameworks not covered by standard report types. Provide a clear, detailed prompt for best results.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Check research context before generation">
    Check your project's Research Goals and Interview Guide before generation—they're automatically included in the context for better results. Update them if your research focus has changed.
  </Accordion>
