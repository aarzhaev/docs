description: "Create public links to share records and reports with stakeholders without requiring Aseed accounts."

## Overview

Public links allow you to share records and project reports with stakeholders who don't have Aseed access. Anyone with the link can view the content in a read-only mode without needing to sign in or create an account. Public links are perfect for sharing research findings with clients, executives, or team members.

## What can be shared publicly

You can create public links for two types of content:

| Content Type | Description | Public URL Format |
|--------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Single Records** | Individual interview records with all reports (Transcript, Q&A, General, Persona, JTBD, Custom) | `/space/records/public/{recordId}` |
| **Project Reports** | Aggregated project reports with insights from multiple interviews | `/space/projects/public/{projectId}/reports/{reportId}` |

<Tip>
Public links work for both single records and project reports. Choose the content type that best fits what you want to share with stakeholders.
</Tip>

## How to share single records publicly

Single records can be shared publicly, giving access to all reports (Transcript, Q&A, General, Persona, JTBD, Custom) for that specific interview.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the record">
    Navigate to the record you want to share. You can access records from the Records page or from your project's records list.

      You can also copy the public link directly from the Records table by clicking the "Public" badge in the Public column.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Disable when needed">
    To revoke access, open the sharing modal again and toggle off **Public link**. The link will immediately stop working for all recipients.

    <Tip>
      Disabling a public link is instant and affects everyone who has the link. Use this to maintain control over who can access your research.
    </Tip>

## How to share project reports publicly

Project reports can be shared publicly, giving access to aggregated insights from multiple interviews.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the project report">
    Navigate to the project report you want to share. You can access project reports from your project's reports section or from the Project Reports page.

  <Step title="Copy and share the link">
    Click **Copy Link** to copy the public URL to your clipboard, then share it with stakeholders.

    <Tip>
      Include context when sharing project reports—explain the research objectives, key findings, or specific sections you want stakeholders to focus on.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Manage access">
    You can disable the public link at any time from the sharing modal. When disabled, the link immediately stops working for all recipients.

    <Note>
      Project owners can still access the report through their regular Aseed account even if the public link is disabled.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What's hidden in public view

For security and privacy, certain information is automatically hidden from public pages:

| Hidden Information | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **Your name & email** | Personal account information is not visible to public viewers |
| **Research objectives** | Project goals and research context are hidden from public access |
| **AI Chat messages** | Messages you sent in the AI Chat are not visible on public pages |

<Tip>
All report content (transcripts, insights, recommendations) is visible in public view. Only personal information and research context are hidden.
</Tip>

## Public page limitations

Public pages have specific limitations to ensure security and prevent unauthorized actions:

| Limitation | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Read-only access** | Public viewers cannot edit, delete, or modify any content |
| **No report generation** | Public pages do not support generating new reports or re-running analysis |
| **No AI Chat access** | The AI Chat feature is not available on public pages |
| **No export functionality** | Public viewers cannot export reports to DOCX or Markdown |
| **Setup tab locked** | For project reports, the Setup tab is locked for non-owners on public pages |

<Note>
Public pages are designed for viewing and sharing research findings, not for active collaboration or editing.
</Note>

## Quick copy from Records table

You can quickly copy public links directly from the Records table:

1. Navigate to the **Records** page
2. Find the record you want to share
3. Look for the **Public** column
4. If the record is already public, click the **Public** badge to copy the link
5. If the record is not public, enable public sharing first through the record's sharing modal

<Tip>
The Public column in the Records table shows a badge for records that are already public. Click the badge to instantly copy the public link.
</Tip>

## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Review content before sharing">
    Review the record or report content before enabling public sharing to ensure it's ready for external stakeholders. Check for any sensitive information, incomplete sections, or incomplete analysis.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Include context when sharing">
    Include a brief summary or context when you send the link so recipients know what to expect. Provide information about the research objectives, key findings, or specific sections you want stakeholders to focus on.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Disable links when no longer needed">
    Disable public links when they're no longer needed to maintain security and control access. This is especially important for records and reports containing sensitive research data or confidential information.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use for stakeholder communication">
    Public links are ideal for sharing research findings with clients, executives, or team members who don't need full Aseed access but need to review insights and recommendations.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Combine with export for presentations">
    For presentations or meetings, consider exporting the report to DOCX or Markdown in addition to sharing the public link. This provides offline access and allows for annotation or note-taking.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Monitor link usage">
    While Aseed doesn't currently provide analytics on public link usage, you can track engagement by asking stakeholders for feedback or monitoring when links are accessed through your own communication channels.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

| **Content shared** | All reports for one interview (Transcript, Q&A, General, Persona, JTBD, Custom) | Aggregated insights from multiple interviews |
| **Access to tabs** | All report tabs visible | Setup tab locked for non-owners, Report tab visible |
| **Copy from table** | Yes, via Public badge in Records table | No, only through sharing modal |
| **Use case** | Share individual interview findings | Share project-level synthesis and insights |
