## A research tool built for a specific workflow
Aseed is an AI-powered research assistant designed for customer and user interviews. It helps you move from raw recordings to structured insights and reports without manual synthesis.

## Why Aseed exists
- Interviews are rich but hard to analyze at scale.
- Teams need consistent insights, not ad-hoc summaries.
- Research outcomes should be easy to share and reuse.

## How Aseed is different from general AI assistants
General tools like ChatGPT or NotebookLM are great for open-ended conversation, but they are not built around the research workflow. Aseed is specialized and handles the full flow from project setup to report synthesis.

| Focus | Aseed | General assistants (ChatGPT, NotebookLM) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Purpose | Research workflow and report generation | General chat, notes, and summaries |
| Context | Analyzes the full project context you provide | Often works from prompts and retrieved snippets |
| Workflow | Structured steps from interviews to reports | Ad-hoc conversations |
| Output | Consistent report formats ready to share | Unstructured responses that need manual editing |

Unlike notebook-style tools that rely on retrieval from source documents, Aseed is built to analyze the full context you provide across the project.
