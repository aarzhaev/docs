## The complete workflow

Aseed helps you transform interview recordings into actionable insights through a structured workflow. Follow these steps to go from raw interviews to shareable reports:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a project">
    Set up a project to organize your research. Give it a clear name that describes your study, and optionally add interview files during creation.
    
    **Learn more:** [Create a project](/projects/create)
    
    <Tip>
      Projects help you organize interviews, context, and reports in one place. You can create a project with or without files—files can be added later.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add research context (recommended)">
    Improve analysis quality by adding research goals and an interview guide. This helps Aseed generate more relevant and focused insights.
    
    **Learn more:** [Add research context](/projects/context)
    
    <Expandable title="Create an interview guide with AI">
      Use the [Interview Guide Builder](/interviews/guide-builder) to generate a structured interview guide based on your research goals, or write your guide manually.
    </Expandable>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Upload interview files">
    Add audio, video, or text files to your project. Files upload in the background, so you can continue working while they process.
    
    **Learn more:** [Upload records to project](/projects/upload-records) or [View all records](/interviews/records)
    
    <CardGroup cols={2}>
      <Card title="Supported formats" icon="file">
        **Audio:** MP3, WAV, M4A, OGG  
        **Video:** MP4, MOV, AVI, WebM  
        **Text:** TXT, DOCX, PDF, MD, SRT, VTT
      </Card>
      <Card title="File size limits" icon="hard-drive">
        **Minimum:** 1KB (text) or 1MB (media)  
        **Maximum:** 5GB per file
      </Card>
    </CardGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Transcribe and review">
    Generate accurate transcripts from audio/video files, or upload pre-written text transcripts. Review and edit transcripts to ensure accuracy before generating reports.
    
    **Learn more:** [Transcribe interviews](/interviews/transcribe) and [Edit transcripts](/interviews/edit)
    
    <Tip>
      Accurate transcripts lead to better insights. Take time to review and correct transcripts, especially speaker names and key terminology.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate single reports">
    Create per-interview reports to analyze individual interviews in isolation. Start with Transcript and Q&A reports, then add General, JTBD, Persona, or Custom reports as needed.
    
    **Learn more:** [Generate single reports](/reports/single) and [Report types](/reports/report-types)
    
    <Expandable title="Batch generation">
      Process multiple records at once using [Batch generation](/projects/batch-generation) to save time when working with many interviews.
    </Expandable>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Build a project report">
    Synthesize insights across multiple interviews into one aggregated report. Project reports identify patterns, themes, and insights across your entire research project.
    
    **Learn more:** [Create a project report](/reports/project)
    
    <Tip>
      Project reports combine data from all selected records. Make sure you've generated single reports for the interviews you want to include.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Share or export">
    Publish your report with a public link or export it in various formats (PDF, DOCX, Markdown) for stakeholders.
    
    **Learn more:** [Share publicly](/sharing/public) and [Export reports](/sharing/export)
  </Step>
</Steps>
