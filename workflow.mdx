## The complete workflow

Follow these steps to move from raw interviews to shareable insights:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a project">
    Set up a project to organize your research. Give it a clear name that describes your study, and optionally add interview files during creation.
    
    **Learn more:** [Create a project](/projects/create)
    
    <Tip>
      Projects help you organize interviews, context, and reports in one place. You can create a project with or without files—files can be added later.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Fill research context and interview guide">
    Define your **Research Goals** and **Interview Guide** together. This is the preparation stage for AI interviews.

    Use the **Research Context Builder** in the AI Agent to generate both through guided Q&A, or fill both fields manually in the project.

    **Learn more:** [Add research context](/projects/context) and [Create interview guide](/interviews/guide-builder)

    <Tip>
      Keep goals and guide specific. Better context produces better interview questions and better reports.
    </Tip>

    */}
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create AI interview links and send them to respondents">
    Open **AI Interviewer** in the project, create interview links, and send one link per respondent.

    **Learn more:** [AI Interviewer](/projects/ai-interviewer)

    <Tip>
      Completed AI interviews are saved as project records automatically.
    </Tip>

    */}
  </Step>

  <Step title="Upload previously recorded interviews">
    Add existing audio, video, or text interviews that were recorded outside Aseed.

    **Learn more:** [Upload records to project](/projects/upload-records) or [View all records](/interviews/records)

    <CardGroup cols={2}>
      <Card title="Supported formats" icon="file">
        **Audio:** MP3, WAV, M4A, OGG  
        **Video:** MP4, MOV, AVI, WebM  
        **Text:** TXT, DOCX, PDF, MD, SRT, VTT
      </Card>
      <Card title="File size limits" icon="hard-drive">
        **Minimum:** 1KB (text) or 1MB (media)  
        **Maximum:** 5GB per file
      </Card>
    </CardGroup>

    */}
  </Step>

  <Step title="Transcribe and review recordings">
    Upload pre-written transcripts for text files, or generate transcripts for audio/video files. Review and edit before generating reports.

    **Learn more:** [Upload text transcripts](/interviews/text-transcripts), [Transcribe interviews](/interviews/transcribe), and [Edit transcripts](/interviews/edit)

    <Tip>
      Accurate transcripts lead to better insights. Review speaker names and key terminology before report generation.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate single reports">
    Create per-interview reports to analyze individual interviews in isolation. Start with Transcript and Q&A reports, then add General, JTBD, Persona, or Custom reports as needed.
    
    **Learn more:** [Generate single reports](/reports/single) and [Report types](/reports/report-types)
    
    <Expandable title="Batch generation">
      Process multiple records at once using [Batch generation](/projects/batch-generation) to save time when working with many interviews.
    </Expandable>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Build a project report">
    Synthesize insights across multiple interviews into one aggregated report. Project reports identify patterns, themes, and insights across your entire research project.
    
    **Learn more:** [Create a project report](/reports/project)
    
    <Tip>
      Project reports combine data from all selected records. Make sure you've generated single reports for the interviews you want to include.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Share or export">
    Publish your report with a public link or export it in various formats (PDF, DOCX, Markdown) for stakeholders.
    
    **Learn more:** [Share publicly](/sharing/public) and [Export reports](/sharing/export)
  </Step>
</Steps>
